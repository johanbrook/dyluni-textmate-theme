# Dyluni Theme for Textmate

Simple light-on-dark theme with support for Sass syntax highlighting. You need to grab the Sass Textmate bundle by [seaofclouds](https://github.com/seaofclouds) as well, which [I've forked here](https://github.com/johanbrook/sass-textmate-bundle).

## Installation

Simply drag the Dyluni.tmTheme file to the Textmate dock icon.
